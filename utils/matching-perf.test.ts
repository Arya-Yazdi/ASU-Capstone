🚀 Hey there! We’re OrderIQ, a restaurant tech startup redefining the point-of-sale experience. Fresh off our pre-seed round, we’re building a modern, offline-first iPad POS system using React Native, and we’re looking for our next engineers to help bring it to life. If you're passionate about crafting high-performance apps for real-world use in a modern tech-stack, we’d love to talk.

 

The ideal candidate will be responsible for developing, testing, and debugging a native iPad POS application for restaurant operations. Using React Native, TypeScript, and modern architecture patterns, this candidate will build a robust tablet interface that connects to our Node.js backend APIs, handles real-time updates, and provides a reliable offline-first experience.

 

Responsibilities

Designing, developing, and testing React Native UI for iPad-based POS operations
Build reusable React Native components and libraries for API integration and local storage
Create intuitive touch interfaces optimized for fast order entry on iPad
Implement offline-first architecture with SQLite/MMKV for caching and queue management
Integrate with Node.js backend APIs for order submission, payment processing, and data sync
Develop dedicated kitchen view mode for separate iPad screen with live order updates
Implement kiosk mode functionality to lock devices to POS application only
Build background processes for queue management and data synchronization
Implement pre-configured device deployment with embedded restaurant credentials
Design local state management for cart, modifiers, and order flow
Ensure reliable offline operation with automatic sync when connection restored
Create robust error handling and user feedback for hardware/network failures

 

Qualifications

Bachelor's degree or equivalent in Computer Science
3+ years' experience in React Native development
2+ years' experience building for iOS or iPadOS tablets
Experience building offline-capable applications with SQLite or MMKV
Strong understanding of React Native architecture and state management (Redux/Zustand/Recoil)
Experience with WebSocket or real-time API clients
Familiarity using Scrum/Agile development methodologies
Understanding of iOS kiosk mode strategies, device locking, and TestFlight deployment
Experience with queue-based sync patterns and local error handling

 

Preferred Qualifications

Experience with enterprise POS systems
Experience building role-based UI (e.g. front-of-house vs. kitchen views)
Familiarity with Stripe Terminal SDK
Understanding of restaurant operations and workflows
Experience with background syncing and retry logic
Familiarity with iOS MDM, device provisioning, or single-app mode tools
Experience with WebSocket client implementation
Experience deploying production apps to iPads in field environments
